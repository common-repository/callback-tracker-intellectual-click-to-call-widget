== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Callback? =
Callback Tracker allows users to call your representatives directly through your site for free. Every callback results in two calls - one to the web visitor and another one to you.
Use Callback Tracker on any website to access phone calls, live chat, SMS, and email communication.

= What happens if all my incoming lines are busy? =
Customers details will be logged in your dashboard and you can get back to them when you can.

= Why is your callback feature a better option than a toll free number? =
Toll free numbers are more costly and require a hardware setup. This isn’t ideal for smaller companies. Callback is a hassle-free and cost-effective solution for both you and your visitors.
